\title{Inbreeding avoidance in the Great Tit (\emph{Parus major})}
\description{
This is a simulated data set of geographical locations and relatedness measures for two populations of Great Tits, a small passerine. Both populations share the geographical locations, but not the relatedness tables. The first population does not show inbreeding avoidance, while the second does.
